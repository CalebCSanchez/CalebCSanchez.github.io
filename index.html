			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<p>I will say that my Github projects are mostly not in C# mainly due to the fact that I work in C# for a living. Usually I upload stuff to github to help me learn other things outside of my current job. Feel free to check out the projects I have made!</p>
			<div class="project">
				<h3><a href="https://github.com/CalebCSanchez/MakeComputerGoNightNight" target="_blank" style="color: #ff6fd8;">Make Computer Go Night Night</a></h3>
				<p>This project was made to shut down my computer after a certain amount of time. It's just a cool ui that would let me watch videos as I fell asleep and turn the computer off.</p>
